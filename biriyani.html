                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dindigul Zahir Biriyani is a popular restaurant in dindigul that offers an array of biryanis, including chicken, mutton, and egg. The biryani is cooked using the traditional dum method, which involves slow cooking the rice and meat together in a sealed pot. This gives the biryani its unique flavor and aroma. The restaurant has a cozy ambiance, and the staff is friendly and efficient 🍗🍗.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of Dindigul Biryani traces back over 200 years to the humble beginnings of the Perumal Naidu Biryani Hotel, where the first iteration of this iconic dish was born. Founded by G Perumal Naidu, this eatery started as a modest establishment serving a concoction known as milagu kuzhambu, a pepper gravy made with mutton and spices.
